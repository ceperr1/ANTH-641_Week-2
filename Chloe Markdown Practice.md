##### What interests me..

* How to use 3D Data Capturing 
* Learning a new "language"
* Actually understanding something about computers

I enjoyed the section about *Failing Productively* in ODAT because I am nervous about working with anything digital..
> We have found that students are very nervous about doing digital work because, ‘what if it breaks?’ and ‘what if I can’t get it to work?’ This is perhaps a result of high-stakes testing and the ways we as educators have inculcated all-or-nothing grading in our courses. There is no room for experimentation, no room for trying things out when the final essay is worth 50% of the course grade, for instance. Playing it safe is a valid response in such an environment. A better approach, from a pedagogical point of view, is to encourage students to explore and try things out, with the grading being focused on documenting the process rather than on the final outcome.

I always find the best encouragment from Papa Stalin
